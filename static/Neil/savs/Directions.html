a single lane each way.
Turn right at Mayfield Ave.<P>
<TD><h3>From Interstate 280</h3>
Coming from the north, exit I-280 at Sand Hill Road and follow the
East signs.  At the intersection of Santa Cruz Ave and Junipero Serra
Blvd, turn right, then get into the left lane quickly to turn left
onto Junipero Serra; follow it past Campus Drive West to Campus Drive
East and turn left.  Once on Campus Drive East, follow it to the four-way stop at
Mayfield and turn left.<P>
Coming from the South, exit I-280 at Page Mill Road and follow the
East signs.  At the second stop light, turn left onto Junipero Serra;
at the second stop light, turn right onto Campus Drive East.  
Once on Campus Drive East, follow it to the four-way stop at
Mayfield and turn left.</TABLE>
At the next stop sign, where Mayfield makes a sharp bend to the left, 
you will be facing the Braun Music Center,
which is a two-story tan stucco building, with an archway through the
middle.
Turn left at the stop sign, following Mayfield's bend.
The first right off Mayfield is the entrance into
the parking lot nearest to Dinkelspiel, Braun and the Old Union.<P>

Enter and find parking.
After parking, walk towards the campus buildings (away from Mayfield Avenue). 
One end of Braun Music Center 
is the tan stucco building on your right.<P>
Campbell Recital Hall is on the ground floor,
in the end of the building nearest the parking lot and
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Braun Rehearsal Hall is also on the ground floor,
to the right of Campbell Recital Hall and the atrium.
To reach Braun 103-106, walk down the hallway away from Campbell Recital Hall,
through the glass 
doors, across the archway (watch for bicycles!), 
straight across into the "other side" of Braun and 
down the hallway. Braun 105 and 106 are on your left before the hallway turns
left; to get to 103 take two left turns, past the Music Library and around to room 103.
The door to 103 is opposite the windows that look out toward the Post Office.

which is between Dinkelspiel and Braun,
on your right as you face the main entrance of Dink, with Tresidder 
behind you.<P>
The Dinkelspiel rehearsal hall is located under the stage.
Use the stage door entrance beside the loading dock,
and turn left at the bottom of the stairs.

White Plaza - go down the stairs and across the
hall to enter the rehearsal hall.<P>


<H2>Directions to: <A NAME="Annex">The Annex </A>, Room A1</H2>
<A HREF="Savoymap.html">[map]</A> The Annex is usually a weeknight rehearsal venue.
It is located behind The Knoll. <P>
Directions:
Proceed as you would if going to 
<A HREF="Directions.html#Braun">Braun</A>,
but pass by the parking lot.
Mayfield dead-ends into Lomita in about a quarter mile.
[From here, take all the roadway choices that lead upward.] 
Turn left on Lomita. You will shortly come to a 2-way fork in the road.<P>
Bear right (upwards).
The road will fork again immediately; bear right (again, upwards)
and at the next fork, bear left (still upwards), driving behind the
Knoll (a pink stucco mansion on top of the hill).
You are now on a one-way road.
The Annex is down the slope to your right as you drive in,
consisting of the two temporary buildings behind the large 
former mansion to your left.  Find parking - be sure not to block the
road, as this is a fire lane.  
A1 is the large central room in the temporary building furthest to the left
(not the one with the bathroom sign).<P>

<H2>Directions to: <A NAME="Elliot">Elliot Program Center</A></H2>
<A HREF="Savoymap.html">[map]</A> The Elliot Program Center is often
our Saturday morning rehearsal venue.

(usually dry) Lake Lagunita. <P>
Directions:
Proceed as you would if going to 
<A HREF="Directions.html#Braun">Braun</A>, but pass by the parking lot. 
Mayfield dead-ends into Lomita in about a quarter mile.
Turn right on Lomita, and continue until it dead-ends into Santa Teresa St.
Turn left on Santa Teresa.
Pass Roble Hall on the left, Roble Gym on the right, and Lagunita Court
on the left.
Opposite the fields past Roble Gym, turn left into the large parking
lot ringed by dormitories, and containing many large eucalyptus trees.
Find parking and walk away from Santa Teresa St., 
towards the interior of the lot.
Follow the small road past the bollards around the 
rightmost dorm at the back of the lot.
There is a green canopy over a doorway at the back of this building.
The back of the Governor's Corner dorms are to your right.
Across a small parking lot you will see the levee around
Lake Lagunita, and a stairway leading up to a building next to the levee.
Go up the stairs.  Enter via the doors on the lakeside 
deck of the building. <P>

<A HREF="Directions.html#Braun">Braun Music Center</A> and
<A HREF="Directions.html#Dink">Dinkelspiel Auditorium</A>
on your right.
Keep going past the outdoor seating area of Tresidder.
Ahead of you is
the Old Union, the old Spanish style building on White Plaza,
facing the Stanford Bookstore.<P>
The Costume Shop is in the Clubhouse wing of the Old
Union (the part nearest Tresidder and Dink), on the second
floor.
The front doors of the Clubhouse wing open onto the Old Union
courtyard, on the opposite side
of the building to the one you are now facing.
Go around the building, either to the left
(under the arched colonnade),
or to the right.
Enter the front doors, which are up a few brick steps,
go up the steps to the first landing and enter the large
ballroom to your left (which has a small stage at the rear).
In the rear left corner of the room (to the left
of the small stage) is the door to our costume shop.
(If an event is taking place in the ballroom, politely
creep around the edge of the room to get to the shop).<P>
