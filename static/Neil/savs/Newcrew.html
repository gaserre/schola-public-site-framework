<H2>Behind-the-scenes opportunities with the Stanford Savoyards</H2>
Even if you can't sing or play a note, you can help be part of the production company that makes our shows happen.  Whether you have stage-managed or sewn costumes until you can do it in your sleep, or have never seen what goes on behind the scenery before, you can become a part of the Savoyards family.<P>
As is appropriate for a university organization, we consider the Savoyards to be a training ground for backstage as well as onstage talent.  We can teach you what you need to know to be part of the creative process. And we will gladly learn from you if you know how to do it better, faster, lighter, or cheaper.<P>

staff contacts.
