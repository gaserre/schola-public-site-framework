Gilbert & Sullivan's shows did much to transform the Victorian view of
the theatre from slightly disreputable into a perfectly respectable
form of entertainment for the entire family.  We encourage families to
introduce their youngsters to the special magic of live performances,
but for the greatest enjoyment of both the children and other audience
members, please be sure the young people are prepared for a two to
two-and-a-half hour performance.  Children under 10 must be
accompanied by an adult, and must sit with that adult through the
entire performance.<P>
