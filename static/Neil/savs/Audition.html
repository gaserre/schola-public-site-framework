<H2>Stanford Savoyards Audition Information</H2>
<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/savoyards/"><B>Dates, times,
and places of our next auditions</B></A> are posted on our main site
as soon as the details are set.<P>

Auditioning for the Savoyards is easy! We hold auditions in late September 
for our fall show and in January for our spring show.  We send out audition announcements via direct mail and electronic mail.  Click here for information on joining the <A HREF="./Contact.html">mailing lists</A>.<P>
Come to one of the auditions with a prepared song, preferably in 
English. Bring sheet music in the proper key for our accompanist.<P>
When you arrive, you will fill in an audition form indicating<P>
<UL>
<LI>what role(s) you would like to be considered for
<LI>your vocal range
<LI>your prior stage experience, if any
<LI>what non-performing areas you will help with (all cast members are 
required to help with at least one non-performing job such as costume 
or set construction, publicity, etc.)
<LI>any known rehearsal conflicts
<LI>how we can contact you.
</UL>
In addition, the audition form will ask for your commitment to be "off-book" in your part by a given date.  You will then sign up for an 
audition time slot and your picture will be taken.<P>
You will audition for the Music and Stage Director(s) and Producer(s).  During
 the audition we will<P>
<UL>
<LI>Talk over any items of interest on your audition form
<LI>Hear you sing the song you have prepared
</UL><P>
If the directors want to consider you for a lead role or roles, you
will be told which musical numbers and dialogue scenes to prepare for
callbacks.  In addition, after all initial auditions are over, lead
callbacks and chorus cast lists will be posted on campus and on this
website; specific details will be handed out at initial auditions.<P>

<B>Rehearsal</B> schedules may differ slightly from show to show, but
usually Sunday, (either Monday or Tuesday), and Wednesday evenings from 7 to 10 p.m. and
Saturday mornings from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. are the rehearsal time slots.
Some dates will be chorus only, women only, men only, leads only, and
so forth, so you may not be called to each rehearsal. The rehearsal
schedule will include extra dates during the week before opening
night; these will be announced at audition time.  Schedules will be
available at auditions and rehearsals.<P>

Cast parties (for the entire company) are held after each performance, and at additional times.
